Title: Classical and Bayesian Methods for Markov Order Estimation under Context-Dependent Nucleotide Substitution

Abstract: DNA evolution is context-dependent, meaning that substitution rates depend on neighbouring nucleotides (Siepel & Haussler, 2004). Consequently, the probability of observing a given base may depend on multiple preceding bases, suggesting an underlying Markov dependence structure of a certain order. This Honours Project extends my earlier UROPS work on estimating the Markov order of genomic sequences using frequentist approaches. Rather than analysing the human reference genome, which lacks precise information on variation and evolutionary processes, this study simulates sequence evolution under two context-dependent substitution models: the CpG model, capturing first-order dependence arising from the elevated C → T transition rate in CpG dinucleotides, and the A → G transition model, representing higher-order dependence driven by neighbouring nucleotides up to two positions away from the mutating base (Zhu et al., 2017). The Markov orders of the descendant sequences are then estimated using classical methods, including sequential likelihood ratio tests and information criteria, as well as Bayesian inference, which models transition probabilities with Dirichlet priors (Strelioff et al., 2007). This study further examines how sequence length, type of ancestral sequence, evolution time, and edge effects influence the resulting Markov orders. Under the CpG model, all estimation methods consistently recovered the expected first-order dependence across different simulation settings. In contrast, results under the A → G transition model were less conclusive, particularly for shorter sequences and biased ancestral compositions, highlighting the challenges of detecting higher-order dependence in DNA sequences.
